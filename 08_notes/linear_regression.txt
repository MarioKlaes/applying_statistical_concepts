Linear Regression
=================================================================================================
Relate 2 or more variables (in alinear way) using one to predict the other.

-> Slope (line inclination)
	-> positive relation: when Y increases(+) X increase(+)
	-> negative relation: When Y increases(+) X decreases(-) (or vice versa)

-> Variance (something) = (sum of the squares / the number of things)^2

How to tell if the linear model is good enough to be used to predict?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-> R^2: used to evaluate if the linear model is good enough to be used to predict

Example: Predict the mouse zise based on mouse weight.
relating mouse size (y) vs mouse weight (x)

->If, R2 = 0.6 = 60% .... this means that mouse weight (x) "explains" 60% of the variation on the  mouse size (y)


Example 2: use Mouse Weight and Mouse Tail Length to predict the Mouse Body Size Length (3D graphic)
-> it is iportant to check the equation ... in any X or Z have a zero this means this variable do not affect the result, therefore, there are no relation.


How to sey if R2 is meaningful and can be used to evaluate the relationship between the variables?
User p-Value!!

How to interpret p-value?
-------------------------

- A low p-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis. In other words, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the predictor variable has a statistically significant effect on the response variable.
==> in other words: p-value < 0.05 one variable can explain the other ... so me model/equation can be used

- Conversely, a high p-value (greater than 0.05) suggests that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the predictor variable has a non-zero correlation with the response variable.
==> in other words: p-value > 0.05 one variable CAN NOT explain the other ... so me model/equation CAN NOT be used

- If the linear regression has more than 2 variables, then the p-value is extremelly important!!
We have 1 p-value for each variable. The p-values > 0.05 can be discarded.

For example, consider a regression output where the p-values for the predictor variables are as follows:
	South: p-value = 0.000 (statistically significant)
	North: p-value = 0.000 (statistically significant)
	East: p-value = 0.092 (not statistically significant)
	In this case, you would likely keep the South and North variables in your model but consider removing East
