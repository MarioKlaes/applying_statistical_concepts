Normal Distribution / Gaussian Distribution / Bell Curve
======================================================================

-> Average = middle point in the bell curve
-> mean = how high the bell curve is
-> standard deviation = how spread the data set it

-> The higher the curve, the more concetrated the data set is; therefore, less variation (small standard deviation)



Bernoulli Distribution
=======================================================================
-> 1 trial with 2 possible outcomes

i.e. 
-> voting: you can vote RED or GREEN
-> answer true or false for a question
-> flip of a coin: givers you OR head OR tails 

Bernulli : the total probability is 1 ... so ... probability of p(FALSE) = 1 - p(TRUE)


Poisson Distribution
=======================================================================
Frequency of an event to occur in a specific period of time or distance.
The events do not depend of each other.

Example:
You create an online course. You expect to receive an average of 4 questions in 1 day. 
You received 7 questions in one day. Surprised by the sudden spike, you want to know how likely it was that you would receive 7 questions.

Anticipated number of questions = 4 (lambda)
Time Interval = one day
y = 7

P(7) = 0.06 ... so ... you have a 6% chance to get 7 questions in 1 day.

Example 2: 
Based on the data of an online search provider, a new company believes its website is viewed 1,500 times per week. 
What is the probability that in the next 4 weeks, the company's website will be viewed more than 5,000 times?

Anticipated number of questions = 4 weeks x 1,500/week -> lambda = 6,000
Time Interval =  4 weeks
y = 5,000


Hypergeometric Distribution
=======================================================================
Frequency of an event to occur in a specific period of time or distance.
The events DO DEPEND of each other.
(when you take one spades card from the poker deck, the probability of the next card be spades reduces)

When you get a poker hand, what is the probability of getting 2 cards of spades?
(probability of 1 specific scenario = get 2 cards of spades)

N = population = 52 cards in the deck
A = total items of interest in the population = 13 possible spade cards
n = sample size = number of cards you get 5
x = number of spade cards you expect to get in a 5 cards hand

= hypgeom.dist (2, 5, 13, 52, FALSE)
= 0.274 = 27.4% chance of getting 2 spade cards in your hand.

When you get a poker hand, what is the probability of getting at least 2 cards of spades?
(probability of MULTIPLE scenarios ... you can get 0, 1, or 2 cards of spades)
= hypgeom.dist (2, 5, 13, 52, TRUE)
= 0.907 = 90.7% chance of getting 0, 1 or 2 spade cards in your hand.


Logistic Regression
=======================================================================
- Logistic regression predicts the probability of an outcome, event, or observation 
falling into one of two possible categories (e.g., yes/no, 0/1, true/false).

- Itâ€™s commonly employed in scenarios where we want to classify data points into two distinct classes.

Use Cases (answer is yes  no):
- Spam Detection: Identifying whether an email is spam or not.
- Medical Diagnosis: Diagnosing diseases based on patient test results.
- ustomer Churn Prediction: Predicting whether a customer will churn (leave) a service.


Cauchy distribution
=======================================================================
